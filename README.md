# Ibrahim Sydock ðŸ¦ˆ
I'm a recent CS graduate expanding my programming knowledge while looking for entry level FTE developer jobs. 

You can find my recent completed projects pinned on my profile. Feel free to check out my repositories to see what I am currently up to or what other open-source projects I am contributing towards.

If you know anyone hiring please let me know as I have the skills necessary to contribute quality code, the willingness to learn, and enjoy collaborating with others.

## Education ðŸŽ“
I graduated from Central Washington University with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. My academia gave me a strong understanding of computer science fundamentals such as Object Oriented Principles, Algorithms, Data Structures, File Processing, Design Principles, and Software Engineering. 

## Work Experience ðŸ’¼
I worked on private repositories at TreeTop Inc during my Summer 2022 Contract. [This](https://github.com/isydock?tab=overview&from=2022-12-01&to=2022-12-31) account contains my contributions info for that period of time.
### Projects
These are some of the projects I worked on and the technologies  utilized.
- **Employee Website**: Improved pages by adding print and merge functionality to a myriad of displayed data, utilized by many others at the company. (Javascript, SQLServer, DB2, Jenkins)
- **Employee Website 2.0**: Used my skills to improve/build UI design, a sitewide error display system, and a dropdown search filter. (Typescript, Jenkins)
- **Career Fair Giveaway App**: Successfully built a necessary web app with REST architecture. User info sent through JSON API call to external app which parsed data and picked a winner to receive an email. A solo project by me. (NodeJS, ExpressJS, Vue & Vuetify)
