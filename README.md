# Hey, I'm Ibrahim Sydock! ü¶à
I'm a recent CS graduate expanding my programming knowledge while looking for entry level FTE developer jobs. 

You can find my recent completed projects pinned on my profile. Feel free to check out my repositories to see what I am currently up to or what other open-source projects I am contributing towards.

If you know anyone hiring please let me know as I have the skills necessary to contribute quality code, the willingness to learn, and enjoy recieving and implementing criticism!

## Skills üí™‚öôÔ∏è
I'm enjoying coding in Python right now, working on a [custom CLI for reaping links](https://github.com/sharktrexer/link-reaper) and Django web apps like my [meal guesser site](https://github.com/sharktrexer/Meal_Guesser). I also enjoy Java and Typescript for web building like [here](https://github.com/sharktrexer/Tooth-Brush-Timer), and have dabbled in C# through Unity projects.
I've used RESTful APIs in my web apps, have made multi-threading and shell projects for linux, and a Docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibrahimsydock/tesseract-receipt-reader) to contain Tesseract OCR code.

In terms of IDEs, I have settled on VSCode as my favorite, but also have utlized JetBrain's IDE, Eclipse, Visual Studio, Spyder, MySQLWorkbench, and NetBeans.

## Interests üéÆ
Other than programming, I enjoy playing video games, cooking/baking, a bit of photography, and nutrition + working out. 

Here's some fun facts:
- Sharks are my favorite animal ü¶à
- Green is my favorite color üíö
- Trapezoids are my favorite shape ‚è¢

## Education üéì
I graduated from Central Washington University with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. My academia gave me a strong understanding of computer science fundamentals such as Object Oriented Principles, Algorithms, Data Structures, File Processing, Design Principles, and Software Engineering. I also minored in Math and Art, so I have a joy for equations and design on top of general comp sci.

## Work Experience üíº
I worked on private repositories at TreeTop Inc during my Summer 2022 Contract. [This](https://github.com/isydock?tab=overview&from=2022-12-01&to=2022-12-31) account contains my contributions info for that period of time.
### Projects
These are some of the projects I worked on and the technologies  utilized.
- **Employee Website**: Improved pages by adding print and merge functionality to a myriad of displayed data, utilized by many others at the company. (Javascript, SQLServer, DB2, Jenkins)
- **Employee Website 2.0**: Used my skills to improve/build UI design, a sitewide error display system, and a dropdown search filter. (DITTO but with Typescript)
- **Career Fair Giveaway App**: Successfully built a necessary web app with REST architecture. User info sent through JSON API call to external app which parsed data and picked a winner to receive an email. A solo project by me. (NodeJS, ExpressJS, Vue & Vuetify)
